        <p>
          This is a quick and easy recipe that results in tender and flavorful
          pork chops.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>4 boneless pork chops, 1/2-inch thick</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 cup beer</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.
            Add pork chops and shake well to coat thoroughly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil
            and heat until sizzling. Add pork chops in a single layer. Saute
            until browned on one side, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn pork chops over
            and cook for an additional 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer pork chops
            to a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add beer, vinegar, mustard, brown sugar, and rosemary to the skillet
            and mix well. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Return pork
            chops to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer
            until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes.
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145
            degrees F (63 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer pork chops to a plate. Increase heat to medium and boil pan
            juices in the skillet until thickened, whisking often, about 3
            minutes. Top pork chops with sauce.
          </li>
        </ol>
